What happens if you give a developer... Unreal Engine 4 and no experience? This, my first game ever made on UE4 with blueprints.

I know other devs did way better than me but I wanted to try for the first time.
Thanks alot to the youtube tutorials and my friends who helped me and gave more ideas!

**Hope you like it! ❣**
