First-time project in Unreal Engine. This is what came out, **Budget Backrooms**.

Non-procedural levels, goofy ahh AI's, and stolen sounds from `freesound.org`. Appreciating if you play it, give some feedack  [here](https://forms.gle/KpLdoD4cHb7tFGoo6) and yeah, enjoy!

The development and sweaty update side of this game can be found on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WVuTB56ag4) (even though the server is dead).

**Enjoy ‚ù£**

## üìã Minimum requirements to setup the project.

* Unreal Engine 4.27.2 or better
* A good PC to open the project (you'll automatically compile the shaders when opening the project for the first time)
* Visual Studio 2022 (optional, only install it if you'd like to build it for Windows)

### üîå Plugins (optional)

You can check the available & required plugins inside ![BudgetBackrooms.uproject](https://github.com/DavidJoacaRo/Budget-Backrooms/blob/main/BudgetBackrooms.uproject) by opening it with an text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

More plugins will be required to be installed when you start up the project, you'll get a prompt, click yes or no if you want to use them, also open the project again if nothing pops up.

**Discord Rich Presence plugin is the only paid plugin used in this project.**


# üõ† Setting up the project:

* Download the project | You can download the ZIP or clone it with git, or just use whatever you're familiar with, an example can be found in the screenshot below: ![something like this](https://cdn.upload.systems/uploads/qRf7X7qy.png)



* Create a folder wherever you like to place the project.
* Extract the ZIP
* And then simply open up the project ![kinda like this](https://cdn.upload.systems/uploads/rlCjlmMr.png)
