First-time project in Unreal Engine 4. This is what came out, **Budget Backrooms**.

Non-procedural levels, goofy ahh AI's, and stolen sounds from `freesound.org`. I would appreciate it if you play it, give some feedback  [here](https://forms.gle/KpLdoD4cHb7tFGoo6) and yeah, enjoy!

The development and sweaty update side of this game can be found on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WVuTB56ag4) (even though the server is dead).

**Enjoy ‚ù£**
